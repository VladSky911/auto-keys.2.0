    "q2": {
      "q": "Which documents do I need?",
      "a": "We usually require a valid ID and the vehicle registration. If your documents are locked inside, we first open the car and then check them. Without proof of authorization we do not open vehicles."
    },
    "q3": {
      "q": "How are the costs calculated?",
      "a": "The total price consists of travel, working time, difficulty of the opening and possible material and programming costs for new keys. Night, weekend and holiday surcharges apply only if your job falls into these times."

    "q4": {
      "q": "Can you open any vehicle?",
      "a": "We deal with a wide range of cars every day, from compact cars to vans and premium vehicles. For rare imports or special conversions we check in advance whether we have the right tools – in most cases we do."

      "q": "Will my insurance pay for this?",
      "a": "That depends on your policy. Many partial or full comprehensive policies cover part of the costs for key loss or car opening. We provide a detailed invoice so you can submit a claim."
